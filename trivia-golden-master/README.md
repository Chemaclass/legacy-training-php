# Trivia Golden Master Kata

## Description:
This is a legacy code kata simulates that implements the Trivia game.

The code is small but it has a lot of code smells and sometimes it's difficult to understand.
 
## Goals:
- Create a Golden Master piece to ensure the the Trivia game continues working as before.
- Optionally you can refactor the code helped with the Golden Master created previously.

## Run the code

**Locally** with PHP 7 on Linux and Mac

    make run
**Docker**

on **Linux and Mac**

    make docker-run

on **Windows**

    docker run -v %cd%:/opt/project php:7.2 make run
